# Java

The main() method is required. Any code inside the main() method will be executed.

Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen.
The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).
