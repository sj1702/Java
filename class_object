Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

example 
   class is fruit, so objects will be Apple, Banana, fig, kiwi, Mango etc
   class is car, so objects will be Maruti, Audi, Toyota, BMW, Nissan etc
   
So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.

Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. 
For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

To create a class, use the keyword class
